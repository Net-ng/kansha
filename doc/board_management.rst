   The list of the boards the logged used has access to.


In the board list on you home, you can see all boards you have access to:

* the boards you own;
* the boards you've been invited to.


When you hover a board, action icons appear.

On the boards you own, you can:

Archive the board:
    The board will not be accessible anymore, but it is not destroyed. You can restore it anytime.
Add members:
    The *add member* icon (pointed by the orange arrow on the screenshot above) allows you to invite members to you board.
    Invited people can already be users of the application, in which case you can find them by username or email, or you can invite
    new people by entering their emails. The *favorites* is the list of users you are already in relation with.
    You can not revoke members.

On the boards you are simply a member of, you can opt-out anytime.

Give them a name and a color. You can't add nor remove labels from this list.

Card weights
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cards can be weighted by order of importance. If you enable that ranking, you can define a predefined sequence of weights to choose from or let your members freely weight the cards.

Background

Here you can set a wallpaper to you board and change the board title color to match. In particular, if the background image is dark, set a lighter title color for better readability.
